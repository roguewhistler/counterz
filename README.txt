The `counterz' package provides additional tools for manipulating
counters. The package facilitates the use of stealth prefixes for
counter names in order to help distinguish between counters from
multiple input files. The package also provides a means to generate
random counters and save such counter values for future typesetting.

To install, copy the provided file counterz.sty into your local
texmf directory. The provided documentation counterz.pdf contains
user instructions and and commented implementation code. Both
files counterz.sty and counterz.pdf can be generated by running
pdfLaTeX on counterz.dtx and using the program makeindex to
include the change history and index.

The files counterz.dtx and counterz.pdf are also available on
CTAN at https://ctan.org/pkg/counterz .
